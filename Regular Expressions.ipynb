    "### 7.2. re — Regular expression operations\n",
    "This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\\\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a regular Python string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing '\\' and 'n', while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and RegexObject methods. The functions are shortcuts that don’t require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some fine-tuning parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also The third-party regex module, which has an API compatible with the standard library re module, but offers additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2.1. Regular Expression Syntax\n",
    "A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if A and B are both regular expressions, then AB is also a regular expression. In general, if a string p matches A and another string q matches B, the string pq will match AB. This holds unless A or B contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between A and B; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described here. For details of the theory and implementation of regular expressions, consult the Friedl book referenced above, or almost any textbook about compiler construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For further information and a gentler presentation, consult the Regular Expression HOWTO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like 'A', 'a', or '0', are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'. (In the rest of this section, we’ll write RE’s in this special style, usually without quotes, and strings to be matched 'in single quotes'.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters, like '|' or '(', are special. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted. Regular expression pattern strings may not contain null bytes, but can specify the null byte using the \\number notation, e.g., '\\x00'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition qualifiers (*, +, ?, {m,n}, etc) cannot be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix ?, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example, the expression (?:a{6})* matches any multiple of six 'a' characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special characters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'.'\n",
    "(Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any character including a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "'^'\n",
    "(Caret.) Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "'$'\n",
    "Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches before a newline. foo matches both ‘foo’ and ‘foobar’, while the regular expression foo$ matches only ‘foo’. More interestingly, searching for foo.$ in 'foo1\\nfoo2\\n' matches ‘foo2’ normally, but ‘foo1’ in MULTILINE mode; searching for a single $ in 'foo\\n' will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'*'\n",
    "Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+'\n",
    "Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. ab+ will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘b’s; it will not match just ‘a’.\n",
    "\n",
    "'?'\n",
    "Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. ab? will match either ‘a’ or ‘ab’.\n",
    "\n",
    "*?, +?, ??\n",
    "The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against <a> b <c>, it will match the entire string, and not just <a>. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only <a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "{m}\n",
    "Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. For example, a{6} will match exactly six 'a' characters, but not five.\n",
    "\n",
    "{m,n}\n",
    "Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. For example, a{3,5} will match from 3 to 5 'a' characters. Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match aaaab or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a b, but not aaab. The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form.\n",
    "\n",
    "{m,n}?\n",
    "Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible. This is the non-greedy version of the previous qualifier. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa', a{3,5} will match 5 'a' characters, while a{3,5}? will only match 3 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "'\\'\n",
    "Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like '*', '?', and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isn’t recognized by Python’s parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so it’s highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[]\n",
    "Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\\-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character classes such as \\w or \\S (defined below) are also accepted inside a set, although the characters they match depends on whether LOCALE or UNICODE mode is in force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is '^', all the characters that are not in the set will be matched. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5', and [^^] will match any character except '^'. ^ has no special meaning if it’s not the first character in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match a literal ']' inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or place it at the beginning of the set. For example, both [()[\\]{}] and []()[{}] will both match a parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "'|'\n",
    "A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|', use \\|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|].\n",

    "\n",
    "(?...)\n",
    "This is an extension notation (a '?' following a '(' is not meaningful otherwise). The first character after the '?' determines what the meaning and further syntax of the construct is.

(The flags are described in Module Contents.) This is useful if you wish to include the flags as part of the regular expression, instead of passing a flag argument to the re.compile() function.\n",
    "\n",
